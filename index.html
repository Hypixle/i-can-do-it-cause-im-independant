            Writer Groups

            There are three groups of writers in Michael Clay Thompson’s The Writing of Literature. There are the writers who speak out. Those include William Lloyd Garrison, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Another group are the adventure nature writers. These writers are Mark Twain, and Herman Melville. The third group is philosophical writers, who are Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

            The commonality of the writers who speak out is that they speak out through words and writing. William Lloyd Garrison was a writer during the nineteenth century. He was an abolitionist in America who spoke out against slavery. In his document, To the Public, and in speeches he openly opposed slavery. He wrote this in To the Public:

            Oppression! I have seen thee, face to face,

            And met thy cruel eye and cloudy brow;

            But thy soul-withering glance I fear not now—

            For dread to prouder feelings doth give place

            Of deep abhorrence! Scorning the disgrace

            Of slavish knees that at thy footstool bow,

            I also kneel—but with far other vow

            Do hail thee and thy hord of hirelings base:—

            I swear, while life-blood warms my throbbing veins,

            Still to oppose and thwart, with heart and hand,

            Thy brutalising sway-till Afric’s chains

            Are burst, and Freedom rules the rescued land,—

            Trampling Oppression and his iron rod:

            Such is the vow I take—SO HELP ME GOD! (Thompson 144)

            This quote shows how much William hated and spoke out against slavery. Elizabeth Cady Stanton is another bold writer. She fought for women's rights. Chiefly among those was the right to vote. In her Keynote Address she stated:

            This right no one pretends to deny. We need not prove ourselves equal to Daniel

            Webster to enjoy this privilege, for the ignorant Irishman in the ditch has all the civil

            rights he has. We need not prove our muscular power equal to this same Irishman to

            enjoy this privilege, for the most tiny, weak, ill-shaped stripling of twenty-one has all the

            civil rights of the Irishman. We have no objection to discuss the question of equality, for

            we feel that the weight of argument lies wholly with us, but we wish the question of

            equality kept distinct from the question of rights, for the proof of the one does not

            determine the truth of the other. All white men in this country have the same rights,

            however they may differ in mind, body, or estate. (Thompson 148).

            One can immediately see she said, “This right no one pretends to deny;” she believes it is unfair that only men can vote. The writers who speak out change the world.

            The next group is the nature adventure writers. Mark Twain is one of these writers. He wrote Huckelberry Finn and Tom Sawer. Huckelberry Finn is about the adventures Huckelberry Fin has with Jim, a runaway slave, on the Mississippi River. Herman Melville is another writer of this group. He wrote Omoo and Moby Dick. Omoo is about adventures in the south seas. A quote from Omoo is:

            But all this had nothing to do with her sailing; at that, brave Little Jule, plump Little

            Jule, was a witch. Blow high, or blow low, she was always ready for the breeze; and

            when she dashed the waves from her prow, and pranced, and pawed the sea, you never

            thought of her patched sails and blistered hull. How the fleet creature would fly before

            the wind! rolling, now and then, to be sure, but in very playfulness. Sailing to windward,

            no gale could bow her over: with spars erect, she looked right up into the wind’s eye, and

            so she went. (Thompson 139)

            Moby Dick is about a giant white whale that destroyed whaling ships, and a man who wants to kill Moby. All of these books by Mark Twain are adventure books.

            The third group are philosophical writers. The writers in this group are Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Ralph Emerson wrote Self-Reliance. Self-reliance is a trait all philosophers have. It is also a philosophical subject. Self-reliance is controversial. People have many different views on self-reliance. Ralph wrote:

            There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is

            ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his

            portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can

            come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preëstablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieve and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. (Thompson 171)

            This is a philosophical paragraph because one can learn from it and it is controversial.

            In conclusion there are three groups of writers in The Writing of Literature. The ones who speak out, the nature adventure writers, and the philosophical writers.

                I love to ski. Skiing is a means of transport using skis to glide on snow. Variations of purpose include basic transport, a recreational activity, or a competitive winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). Also called "downhill skiing", Alpine skiing typically takes place on a piste at a ski resort. It is characterized by fixed-heel bindings that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier's boot. Ski lifts, including chairlifts, bring skiers up the slope. Backcountry skiing can be accessed by helicopter, snowcat, hiking and snowmobile. Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, après-ski, and glade skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school. Alpine skiing branched off from the older Nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was no longer necessary to climb back uphill. Alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts. More recently the Alpine Touring variant has emerged, commonly referred to as "uphilling". AT setups use specialized bindings which are switchable between locked and free-heel modes. Climbing skins are temporarily attached to the bottom of alpine skis to give them traction on snow. This permits Nordic style uphill and back-country travel on alpine skis. For downhill travel the heels are locked and the skins are removed.
